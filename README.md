# Motivation
In a local competition to get the maximum business value out of a simple Machine Learning project, I used e-commerce products reviews on Amazon with one objective in mind: **Score the helpfulness for each review.**

# Result
The team I was leading won the 3rd place in the competition for building:
- Sentiment Analysis: to classify reviews into 3 classes: positive, negative & neutral.
- Readability Score: to assess how easy or hard reading the review is.

# Plans
Iterating on this project once more and adding a new goal using previous models to build a ML system that determines whether a submitted review is fake or not, to help users assess products objectively.
